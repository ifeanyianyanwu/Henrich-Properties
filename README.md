Henrich-Properties is the official website of Henrich Properties Limited and my first personal & official project. It's a brochure website for the company to display their works and give information about them.
I built the project with HTML, CSS and JAVASCRIPT. I'm working towards rebuilding it with React.js.
It is live on www.henrichpropertiesltd.com.
